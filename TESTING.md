## 0. Getting Started

### 0.1 Open the site & choose a language

1. Go to `bassir-owner-eyes.bassir.net`
2. On the login screen, click **English** or **العربية** at the top — either works identically, this just changes the display language. You can switch again at any time from the same toggle at the top of the sidebar once logged in.

### 0.2 Sign in

Use the account for the role you're testing. You can click an account chip on the login screen to auto-fill it, or type these in directly.

| Role | Username | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin` | `admin123` |
| Owner | `owner` | `owner123` |
| Owner's Representative | `rep` | `rep123` |
| Consultant | `consultant` | `consult123` |
| Project Manager | `pm` | `pm123` |
| Contractor (structural) | `cont-str` | `cont123` |

## A. Project Phases

Confirms the platform now covers all 18 phase types the client asked for — from design approvals through the defects liability period — and that phases can be tailored to the type of project.

### A.1 — Full phase list is available
**Role required:** Admin or Consultant

1. Sign in as `consultant` (or `admin`).
2. In the sidebar, under the "Technical Office" section, click **Project Phases**.
3. Count the phases listed for the current project.

**Expected:** phases appear with a progress bar each. A commercial-tower project (like the demo project) will show **15** — that's correct, not a shortfall: 3 phases (Steel Structure, Landscaping, Infrastructure) are intentionally left out because they don't apply to a tower. The full catalogue of 18 phase types is still available — see A.2.

- [ ] Confirmed

### A.2 — Phases can be customized per project type
**Role required:** Admin or Consultant

1. On the same Project Phases page, open the template dropdown near the top ("Apply template by type...").
2. Choose a different project type, e.g. "Industrial Complex / Warehouses."
3. Confirm you're asked before anything is added, and that only the missing phases for that type get added — nothing already there is removed or duplicated.
4. Click **"+ Phase"** and check the "pick from library" list — it should offer all 18 phase types regardless of project type.

**Expected:** applying a template adds only the phases relevant to that project type; the full list of 18 is always reachable when adding manually.

## D. Today's Updates (2026-09-21 batch)

Everything added or fixed in this round — draft projects, the variation-request schedule panel, priority review for mobilization work, the Arabic-numeral file fix, and the new Project Manager role.

### D.1 — Draft projects hidden until published
**Role required:** Owner's Rep (or Admin) to create; any role to verify visibility

1. Sign in as `rep`. Sidebar → **Projects & Consultants**.
2. Fill in a new project's name, check **"Save as draft"**, and save.
3. Confirm it appears in your own list with a **📝 Draft** badge and a **🔓 Publish Project** button.
4. Sign out, sign in as `consultant` (an account *not* assigned to this project) — confirm the draft does **not** appear anywhere (dashboard project list, project switcher, "All Projects" page).
5. Sign back in as `rep`, click **Publish Project** on it.
6. Sign in as `consultant` again — it should now be visible.

- [ ] Confirmed

### D.2 — Variation request shows the approved schedule
**Role required:** Contractor

1. Sign in as `cont-str`. Contractor Dashboard → **Change Orders** tab → **+ New Request**.
2. Confirm a **📅 Approved Schedule** panel appears (planned finish date + upcoming phases) above the attachments field — this is new; it doesn't appear on any other request type (Shop Drawings, Materials, etc.).
3. Fill in title/value/days and submit — confirm it still goes through normally.

- [ ] Confirmed

### D.3 — Mobilization/preliminary work flagged for priority review
**Role required:** Contractor to submit, Consultant/Project Manager/Owner's Rep to review

1. Sign in as `cont-str`. Sidebar → **Schedule** → upload a CSV/Excel with a task named something like "Mobilization" or "تعبئة الموقع" — send it for approval.
2. Sign in as `consultant` (or `pm`). Sidebar → **Schedule** → look at the pending-approval list.
3. Confirm that submission is sorted to the **top** of the list and highlighted with **"⚡ Includes preliminary/mobilization work — priority review recommended."**

- [ ] Confirmed

### D.4 — Arabic-numeral BOQ/schedule files now read correctly
**Role required:** Contractor

If a BOQ or schedule file (CSV/Excel/PDF) has quantities or prices written with Arabic-Indic digits (١٢٣) instead of regular numbers — common in files exported under Arabic Windows/Excel settings — the system previously read them as zero. This is fixed.

1. Sign in as `cont-str`. Sidebar → **Bill of Quantities** → upload a file containing Arabic-numeral quantities/prices (or re-upload a real file that previously came through as all-zero).
2. Confirm the extracted quantities and prices are correct, not zero.

- [ ] Confirmed

### D.5 — New role: Project Manager
**Role required:** Admin to create/edit; Project Manager to verify scope

1. Sign in as `admin`. Sidebar → **Users & Permissions** → **Add User** → role **Project Manager**.
2. Confirm a **Project** field is required — there is no "All Projects" option, and you cannot save without picking exactly one project.
3. Save, then sign in as that new account (or use the seeded `pm` / `pm123`).
4. Confirm: no project switcher, no "All Projects" link — this account only ever sees the one project it was assigned to.
5. Confirm access **matches Consultant**: Dashboard, Progress Map, Submittals & Approvals (including "Awaiting My Decision"), Technical Office Records, BOQ, Contractors (Contracts tab — add/edit/delete), Cameras, AI, Reports, Schedule, Documents, BIM (including uploading PDF/Primavera/AutoCAD/Revit files), Handover, Project Settings.
6. Confirm access is **denied** to: Users & Permissions, System Settings, Portfolio, Projects & Consultants, Audit Log.
7. Back as `admin`, click **Edit** on the Project Manager account, confirm the Project field is still required and a password reset works.

- [ ] Confirmed

### D.6 — Contractor account: edit + change password
**Role required:** Admin or Owner's Rep

1. Sidebar → **Users & Permissions** → find a contractor account → click **✏️ Edit**.
2. Confirm you can change which contractor company it's linked to, and set a new password.
3. Save, then confirm the new password actually works and the old one no longer does.

- [ ] Confirmed

## Known Limitations

Two items from the original notes that work, but not exactly the way they were described. Worth knowing before reporting them as bugs.

> **⚠ Warranty expiry alerts are visual-only, not push notifications**
> Opening the Warranties tab correctly highlights anything expiring soon — but nothing is sent to the notification bell, email, or WhatsApp on its own. Every other alert in the platform (submissions, reviews, project health) does push a real notification; this one currently doesn't.

> **⚠ The Unified Handover Report exports via print dialog, not a direct PDF download**
> Every other report (weekly, monthly, incident) downloads a PDF file the moment you click the button. The Handover report instead opens a browser print-preview window — you get a real PDF if you choose "Save as PDF" there, but it's a different, slightly less polished path than the rest of the reporting.
